        <h2 id="heading1">Background</h2>

        <p>
            Graduating from the Academy during the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Third_Shinobi_World_War"
            target="_blank">Third Shinobi World War</a>, Shisui was placed on a genin team alongside his best friend. 
            Immediately after the war ended a year later, Shisui witnessed his friend die on a mission, consequently 
            awakening the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Mangeky%C5%8D_Sharingan" 
            target="_blank">Mangekyō Sharingan</a> as he felt responsible.<sup>[3]</sup> A year later, he met a 5 year old 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha" target="_blank">Itachi Uchiha</a>, whom he became best 
            friends with while the two formed a brother-like bond. A year afterwards, Shisui began drawing attention as a 
            genin, garnering the name "<b>Shisui of the Body Flicker</b>" for his usage of the 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Flicker_Technique" target="_blank">
            Body Flicker Technique</a>.<sup>[4]</sup> Two years later, while living with his parents as a 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/J%C5%8Dnin" target="_blank">jōnin</a><sup>[5]</sup> and breadwinner 
            for the family of three, Shisui's bedridden father stopped recognising him due to his decline in health from 
            losing his leg in the last shinobi war. Acknowledging that everybody dies someday, Shisui was prepared for his 
            passing.<sup>[6]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the anime, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Shisui" target="_blank">Team Shisui</a> was 
            assigned a long term mission in which they were tasked with chasing away <a 
            href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kirigakure" target="_blank">Kirigakure</a> forces being lead by 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ao" target="_blank">Ao</a>. The team completed 
            their mission after Ao realised they were facing Shisui and had his team retreat.<sup>[7][8]</sup> When 
            Itachi began to act oddly, Shisui was instructed by the 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Konoha_Military_Police_Force" target="_blank">
            Konoha Military Police Force</a> to monitor Itachi because the younger Uchiha's position in Anbu was 
            instrumental to the Uchiha's future status in Konoha.<sup>[9]</sup> Unbeknownst to the clan, Shisui 
            in reality sympathised with Itachi, not wanting the Uchiha to go to war with the village. As the 
            Uchiha continued to grow angrier and more violent from the distrust of the village due to the 
            suspicion of their involvement in the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nine-Tailed_Demon_Fox%27s_Attack"
            target="_blank">Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack</a>, Shisui approached 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hiruzen_Sarutobi" target="_blank">Hiruzen Sarutobi</a>, revealing 
            the truth to the useless old man. Trusting Shisui, seeing as he is 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kagami_Uchiha" target="blank">Kagami Uchiha</a>'s descendant, 
            Hiruzen allowed the Uchiha to spy on his clan for the village. Shisui was perplexed that the clan would 
            not deter from the coup d'état that they were planning and soon became greatly concerned with the 
            consequences that would follow their actions. Ultimately, it was decided that Shisui would use his 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kotoamatsukami" target="blank">Kotoamatsukami</a> on 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Fugaku_Uchiha" target="blank">Fugaku Uchiha</a>
            to subtly end the coup d'état plan.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="shisui.jpeg" alt="Shisui" style="float:left;width:522px;height:484px;margin-right:30px;
            margin-bottom:30px;">
            Later, as Shisui prepared to make his move, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Danz%C5%8D_Shimura"
            target="blank">Danzō Shimura</a>, believing that simply manipulating the Uchiha's leader wouldn't end the 
            conflict and that Shisui would eventually try to manipulate him as well, chose to take Shisui's eyes for himself 
            like the power-hungry motherfucker he is. While Shisui effortlessly subdued Danzō at first, the 
            piece of shit elder caught Shisui off guard by using the forbidden <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Izanagi"
            target="blank">Izanagi</a> with another <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan" target="blank"
            >Sharingan</a> already in his possession to break free and steal Shisui's right eye. As Danzō and his 
            men surrounded Shisui to take the left eye, Shisui managed to escape.<sup>[10]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Fearing that Danzō was right in Shisui's inability to stop the Uchiha's revolt and that the elder would 
            continue to pursue his left eye as well, Shisui entrusted it to Itachi, telling him to protect both the village 
            and the Uchiha name.<sup>[11]</sup> Shisui wrote a suicide note telling his clan he cannot follow through with the 
            coup d'etat, but his clan's narrow mindedness made them unable to understand this, preventing them from 
            understanding his desire for peace and reconciliation. The contents of the suicide note also made it appear as 
            though he had crushed his eyes when jumping off a cliff into the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naka_River"
            target="_blank">Naka River</a> to kill himself in order to prevent conflict from arising over his eyes within the 
            clan.<sup>[12]</sup> He, at the same time, was able to erase his existence, leaving no corpse 
            behind.<sup>[12][13]</sup> In the anime, Shisui was also hoping to use his death to awaken Itachi's Mangekyō 
            Sharingan, succeeding in his goal.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading2">Personality</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="shisui2.png" alt="Shisui" style="float:right;width:284px;height:481px;margin-left:30px;
            margin-bottom:30px">
            Shisui was a very humble and down-to-earth individual. He was never arrogant about his own talent or 
            accomplishments, yet was not above telling others when they made mistakes. At the same time, he was 
            open-minded, never stubbornly believing solely in one ideal and striving to see the unique nature of 
            the situation before him. Shisui was also a deeply compassionate man, even to enemies, showing sympathy and 
            kindness to a dying <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Mukai_Kohinata" target="_blank">
            Mukai Kohinata</a> despite having been ordered to assassinate him as a traitor. He was also shown to be 
            very perceptive and intuitive even from a young age, able to see through the emotional nature of others and 
            likewise able to notice the smallest details around him.<sup>[5]</sup> Shisui came to care for Itachi very much; 
            in fact, he was like a big brother to Itachi.<sup>[14]</sup> Shisui taught Itachi that "self-sacrifice... a 
            nameless shinobi who protects peace from within its shadow..." was the true mark of a shinobi.<sup>[15]</sup> 
            Shisui was also very devoted to the clan, which is why the Konoha Military Police Force asked him to spy on 
            Itachi. It is because of this devotion that the police did not believe he committed suicide.
            <sup>[2]</sup> Itachi believed that had Shisui been alive during the Uchiha's downfall, he would have protected 
            the clan to the very end, even from him.<sup>[16]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Although Shisui was devoted to his clan, he was equally devoted to the well-being of his village, a trait his own 
            clan is apparently ignorant of. His devotion to his village was so strong that he never fell victim to the 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_Hatred" target="_blank">Curse of Hatred</a>. However, Shisui had 
            a darker side he was deeply ashamed of; out of envy towards a friend he believed had surpassed him in ability, 
            Shisui withheld aid at a critical moment, leading to the other shinobi's death. The guilt of what he had done led 
            Shisui to consider himself a murderer, causing him to awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan, which he used as a constant 
            reminder of his remorse and vow to never succumb to such feelings ever again.<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Shisui's devotion to Konoha even went as far as to attempt to put his clan's leader and best friend's father under 
            a genjutsu in order to stop the Uchiha coup d'état which would lead to civil war.<sup>[17]</sup> However, this 
            failed when Danzō stole his right eye. Knowing Danzō's power-hungry personality would eventually lead him to steal 
            his left eye as well, he resolved to prevent Danzō from stealing it to stop him from gaining too much power. With 
            this in mind, he entrusted his left eye to Itachi and told him to protect the village and was able to die with a 
            smile knowing the village would be in good hands despite all he had been through prior to his death. Shisui even 
            went as far as to erase his own existence to prevent his corpse from falling into the wrong hands, which 
            inadvertently prevented him from being reincarnated by Kabuto years later and being forced to fight his own 
            village.<sup>[18]</sup> According to Itachi, he and <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki"
            target="_blank">Naruto Uzumaki</a> hold similar ideals and goals.<sup>[12]</sup> Shisui also greatly valued the 
            notion of "family" as seen when he swore to never let the clan's issues destroy the relationship between Itachi and 
            Sasuke. He also had a sense of humour, as seen when he enjoyed the difficult situation he put Itachi in when 
            Sasuke argued with Shisui over who is stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like Itachi, Shisui doesn't appear to enjoy killing people and prefers to use non-lethal methods whenever possible 
            as shown in his using a genjutsu to scare off Ao's squad when it was stated he could have killed his entire squad 
            with ease. Shisui also used a genjutsu on Danzō, which would disappear shortly, instead of killing him when the 
            latter tried to steal his eyes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading3">Appearance</h2>

        <p>
            Bearing stark resemblance to his ancestor Kagami Uchiha, Shisui also had short, unkempt dark hair, dark eyes and a 
            relatively broad nose and well-defined eyelashes.
        </p>

        <p>
            He wore the standard attire of the Uchiha clan which includes a high-collared, navy blue outfit along with a 
            tantō strapped to his back. He also wore what appeared to be a harness for his tantō which ran across his chest and 
            fastened over both his shoulders. During his time in the regular forces, Shisui donned the standard Konoha-nin 
            uniform.
        </p>

        <h2 id="heading4">Abilities</h2>
        
        <p>
            <img src="shisui3.jpg" alt="Shisui" style="float:right;width:383px;height:504px;margin-left:30px;
            margin-bottom:30px">
            Even by Uchiha standards, Shisui was noted to be one of the most talented members the famed clan ever 
            had.<sup>[2]</sup> Danzō even hailed him as the strongest Uchiha of his time.<sup>[19]</sup> His abilities allowed 
            him to become a jōnin four years into being a shinobi<sup>[5]</sup> and eventually a captain of his own squad. 
            Soon after, he even became an Anbu. His prowess was so widely known that an entire squad of Kiri-nin quickly fled 
            upon noticing him rather than confront him.<sup>[10]</sup> A further testament to his prowess was 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kabuto_Yakushi" target="_blank">Kabuto Yakushi</a>         
            wanting to <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning:_Impure_World_Reincarnation"

            but being unable to find a sufficient DNA sample for it.
            <sup>[13]</sup>
        </p>
        
            <h3 id="heading4.1">Physical Prowess</h3>

            <p>
                Shisui earned the nickname "<b>Shisui of the Body Flicker</b>" from his signature skill and unmatched mastery 
                of the Body Flicker Technique.<sup>[2]</sup> He could use it to fade out of sight, leaving no trace of either 
                his presence nor an indication of his destination.<sup>[10]</sup> In the anime, his velocity and mobility were 
                so great that he could move undetected by <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sensor_Type" 
                target="_blank">sensor</a> ninja and leave behind multiple tangible 
                <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Afterimage_Clone" target="_blank">after-images</a> that could strike 
                with actual force.<sup>[5]</sup> In battle, his speed could seamlessly dodge barrages of projectiles and 
                likewise outpace a group of enemies. He was also a proficient taijutsu user, able to defeat Itachi in several 
                sparring matches.<sup>[19]</sup> Furthermore, he had high tolerance to pain as he didn't flinch from either of 
                his eyes being removed.<sup>[10][18]</sup>
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="heading4.2"> Ninjutsu</h3>

            <p>
                Shisui was able to <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique" target="_blank">summon</a>
                a flock of crows to aid him and master three basic nature transformations 
                (<a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Release" target="_blank">Fire</a>,

                He was very skilled with using Fire techniques such as his clan's rite of passage

                Great Fireball Technique</a>, which he could perform to a massive size, a very rare feat within in the 
                Uchiha.<sup>[20]</sup> Shisui's usage of this technique required the efforts of many Anbu-level 
                <a href="ttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Release" target="_blank">Water Release</a> users to 
                counteract.<sup>[10]</sup> He also had considerable skill in <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kenjutsu"
                target="_blank">Kenjutsu</a> from a young age, wielding a tantō against two Anbu.<sup>[5]</sup> He showed 
                similarly remarkable <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shurikenjutsu" target="_blank">
                Shurikenjutsu</a>-prowess to Itachi and likewise demonstrated noticeable sleight-of-hand with multiple 
                kunai.<sup>[21]</sup> Shisui also proved to be a very skilled tracker.<sup>[5]</sup>

                    Like many members of his clan, Shisui was a wielder of the Sharingan, which he awakened at a young 
                    age.<sup>[5]</sup> His mastery of the Sharingan rivalled that of Itachi's, both being highly praised for 
                    their especially high skill and sheer power in its usage.<sup>[2]</sup> Using it, he gains access to the 
                    dōjutsu's generic abilities such as seeing chakra, predicting movements, and placing a victim under 
                    paralysis genjutsu upon eye contact. His genjutsu was especially powerful, hailed as the greatest user of 
                    his clan.<sup>[15]</sup> His most <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Genjutsu:_Sharingan"
                    target="_blank">basic techniques</a> could easily trap other powerful users of the Sharingan, 
                    like Danzō, forcing the latter to resort to using Izanagi.<sup>[10]</sup>

                    <img src="Susanoo.png" alt="Shisui's Complete Body Susanoo"
                    style="float:right;width:600px;height:425px;margin-left:30px;margin-bottom:30px">
                    Shisui was one of the few people able to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan. He awakened it when he watched 
                    a dear friend and rival die after withholding his aid in a moment of envy and weakness. Once activated, 
                    its design appears as a four-point pinwheel. Shisui once noted that his Mangekyō Sharingan amplifies 
                    his ability to cast genjutsu by circumventing the need to make eye-contact to make use of its 
                    techniques.<sup>[22]</sup> From this, he could trap multiple individuals in his genjutsu from great 
                    distances.<sup>[10]</sup> Also, needing only to look at a target's eye, he can pour large amounts of 
                    chakra into them in order to increase its ability to keep them trapped.<sup>[22]</sup> It also gives 
                    him access to Kotoamatsukami in each eye.<sup>[15]</sup> Regarded as a unique genjutsu of the highest 
                    calibre, it allowed him to enter the mind of any individual within his field of view by manipulating 
                    them into believing false experiences seamlessly and completely, acting upon them as if they were 
                    truly acting of their own free will.<sup>[8]</sup> This technique was so powerful, Shisui believed he 
                    could secretly use it to make the entire Uchiha clan abandon the coup d'etat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another benefit to awakening his Mangekyō Sharingan was manifesting his 
                    <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Susanoo" target="_blank">Susanoo</a>, which is green in colour. 
                    When manifesting its humanoid form, it takes on a fiendish look with a red tomoe in the centre of its 
                    chest. Its defense was capable of withstanding a large barrage of explosive tags attached to kunai, 
                    leaving Shisui untouched. His Susanoo demonstrated the ability to unleash a 
                    <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Susanoo:_Tsukumo" target="_blank">barrage of chakra needles</a>
                    from its chest and its lance at an incredible speed to swiftly strike down a large group of 
                    targets.<sup>[23]</sup> When manifesting a Complete Body form, his Susanoo gains a spear that he can 
                    rapidly spin to drill enemies into the ground, and which can be coated with fire to 
                    create a vortex of flames.<sup>[24]</sup>

            margin-right:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
            Having been a core member of his clan, his suicide demoralised and lessened the Uchiha's fighting 
            power.<sup>[10]</sup> Throughout his lifetime and even in death, Shisui influenced Itachi greatly as a 
            friend in teaching him self-sacrifice and how a true shinobi must protect his village from within its 
            own shadow. This may have influenced Itachi in his <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Uchiha_Clan_Downfall"
            target="_blank">future actions</a> in staving off a possible civil war within the village which may have 
            escalated into a world war.<sup>[17]</sup> Shisui's effort to erase his very corpse was successful as even 
            Kabuto Yakushi noted that he was unable to locate it in an effort to reincarnate Shisui for the 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_Shinobi_World_War">Fourth Shinobi World War</a>.<sup>[13]</sup> 
            Despite Shisui leaving a note claiming that he was tired of carrying out the clan's duties, the police suspected 
            that Itachi had murdered him and used his Sharingan to forge the suicide note, since suicide was very unlikely 
            for someone of Shisui's character.<sup>[25]</sup> Using Shisui's death to his advantage, Itachi later told
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha" target="_blank">Sasuke Uchiha</a> that he killed Shisui 
            to awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan and forged the suicide note, all in an effort to motivate Sasuke to kill him 
            as repentance for his crimes.<sup>[26]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Even years after his demise, Shisui's powers and actions left their mark on the world. While Danzō used the 
            eye he stole for his questionable agenda of allegedly protecting the village, Itachi kept Shisui's other eye 
            to honour his friend's final request to protect the village and their clan's good name.<sup>[18]</sup> 
            Inserting the eye in the body of a crow, Itachi made final arrangements to implant the bird in Naruto's 
            body as a countermeasure against Sasuke if he learned the truth behind the Uchiha clan's demise and attempted 
            to destroy Konoha.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, due to the immense power that Shisui's eyes held, they were eventually destroyed to prevent them 
            from falling into enemy hands; Danzō destroyed his eye in his final moments to keep 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Obito_Uchiha" target="_blank">Tobi</a> from acquiring it, and a 
            reincarnated Itachi, after Kotoamatsukami was used on him, 
            <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Amaterasu" target="_blank">incinerated</a> the crow holding Shisuis's
            other eye. But Itachi also stated that above all else, Shisui wanted someone to inherit his will and ideals, 
            believing Naruto to be that someone.<sup>[27]</sup>

        <h2 id="heading6">In Other Media</h2>

            <h3 id="heading6.1">Video Games</h3>

            <p>
                Shisui Uchiha is a playable character in the following video games:
            </p>

            <p>
                Insert table here.
            </p>

            <p>
                True to his moniker, Shisui's moves rely mostly on sheer speed attacks. He is also shown using 
                Fire Release <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra_Flow" target="_blank">through</a> his 
                tantō and kunai for more potent and <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Uchiha_Style:_Dance_of_the_Sun_Halo"
                target="_blank">longer-ranged attacks</a>. His team attack is a unified Fire Release followed by a blazing 
                speed assault with Itachi.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, exclusively for the release of this game, Shisui is able to use a green-coloured Susanoo. 
                It wields a drill-like lance that can be used in said fashion and also in unison with Shisui's Fire 
                Release to create a vortex of flames. It is also able to unleash a barrage of energy needles. 
                This was designed by <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Masashi_Kishimoto" target="_blank"
                >Masashi Kishimoto</a> himself. He is also able to manifest a Complete Body Susanoo, gaining a spear 
                that he can rapidly spin in a drill-like manner to drill enemies to the ground, as well as coat it with 
                fire to create a vortex of flames.

        <h2 id="heading7">Trivia</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Shisui's name has two interpretable meanings. Combining the words Shi (死, Death) and Sui (水, Water), 
                Shisui would mean "death water", which is a reference to his death by drowning. "Shisui" (止水) alone 
                means "still water" or "stagnant water".
            </li>
            <li>
                Shisui is Kagami Uchiha's "descendant" (子孫, shison), though their exact relationship is unknown.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the anime, Shisui's Mangekyō pattern is depicted as a pinwheel of four spiralling curves instead of 
                four points.
            </li>
            <li>
